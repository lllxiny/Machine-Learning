**Data Analysis and Model Evaluation**

1. **Package Loading and Data Import:**
   - Load necessary packages, including `glmnet`, `dplyr`, `caret`, and `Hmisc`.
   - Import the heart dataset and display its head to examine its structure.

2. **Data Cleaning and Sample Subset Selection:**
   - Inspect missing values in the dataset and identify variables with a significant number of NA values.
   - Drop columns with more than 20% NA values.
   - Replace NA values in the remaining columns with the mean of the respective column.

3. **Criteria for Training Subset Selection:**
   - Discuss criteria for selecting a balanced training subset, considering class balance and multicollinearity.
   - Run a correlation matrix to assess significant correlations among variables.

4. **Simple Linear Regression Model:**
   - Randomly split the dataset into training (80%) and test sets (20%).
   - Fit a simple linear regression model (full model) to predict heart attack probability using the training data.
   - Calculate the R^2 of the model for the training data.

5. **Model Explanation and In-Sample R^2:**
   - Interpret the results of the simple linear regression model.
   - Calculate the R^2 of the model to explain the proportion of variance explained by the predictors.

6. **Out-of-Sample (OOS) R^2 Calculation:**
   - Predict heart attack probabilities for the test set using the simple linear regression model.
   - Calculate the OOS R^2 by comparing the OOS residual deviance to the OOS null deviance.

7. **Cross-Validation (CV) and Problems:**
   - Explain the concept of cross-validation (CV) as a model selection method.
   - Highlight potential problems associated with cross-validation, including time consumption, instability, and overfitting.

8. **8-Fold Cross-Validation and R^2 Estimation:**
   - Set up an 8-fold cross-validation configuration.
   - Estimate a linear regression model using the 8-fold cross-validation.
   - Calculate the mean R^2 from the cross-validation resampling results.
   - Compare the mean R^2 with the R^2 from the simple linear regression model (Question 1).

9. **OOS R^2 from CV Model:**
   - Use the 8-fold cross-validation model to predict heart attack probabilities for the test set.
   - Calculate the OOS R^2 of the CV model for the test set.
