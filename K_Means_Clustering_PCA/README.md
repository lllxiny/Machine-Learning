**Exploratory Data Analysis, Clustering, and Principal Component Analysis**

This Python code involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), k-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) using a high-dimensional dataset.

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - The code starts by loading the 'madelon.csv' dataset and performs initial data exploration.

2. **Data Normality and Outlier Analysis:**
   - Shapiro-Wilk tests are used to assess the normality of each column's data.
   - The Interquartile Range (IQR) method is employed to identify and count the number of outliers in each column.

3. **Data Scaling and Transformation:**
   - RobustScaler is applied to scale the data due to the presence of outliers.
   - The scaled data is then used for subsequent analyses.

4. **Determining Optimal Number of Clusters:**
   - K-means clustering is run with different values of k (4, 8, 16, 32, 64) on both the original scaled data and PCA-transformed data.
   - Elbow plots are generated to visualize the sum of squared errors (SSE) for each value of k, aiding in the selection of an optimal number of clusters.

5. **PCA and Component Analysis:**
   - PCA is used to transform the scaled data into principal components.
   - A cumulative variance plot is created to show the amount of variance captured by the number of retained components.
   - The number of components required to retain at least 75% of the variance is determined.

6. **Clustering with Transformed Data:**
   - K-means clustering is performed on the PCA-transformed data using the previously identified optimal k value.
   - Scatter plots are used to visualize the transformed data points in the reduced two-dimensional space.

7. **Convergence Analysis:**
   - The code demonstrates the convergence of k-means clustering by generating scatter plots for the first five iterations with k = 32.
   - Data points are color-coded based on cluster assignments, and cluster centers are marked.
