The code performs regression analysis on simulated data, explores the distribution of p-values, assesses the impact of alpha on significance, and controls FDR using the BH procedure. It provides insights into false discoveries and the significance of variables in a controlled FDR setting.

1. **Working Directory and Package Loading:**
   - Set the working directory to a specified location.
   - Load the `ggplot2` package.

2. **False Discovery Rate (FDR) Function:**
   - Define a function named `fdr` to control the false discovery rate.

3. **Generating Data Matrix:**
   - Create a 10,000 x 1001 matrix filled with random values from a normal distribution.

4. **Data Preparation:**
   - Separate the first column of the matrix as the response variable "y".
   - Use columns 2 to 1001 as predictor variables "x".

5. **Regression Analysis:**
   - Perform a linear regression of "y" on "x".
   - Examine the summary of the regression.
   - Calculate residuals and create a histogram.
   - Perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and calculate the mean of residuals.

6. **Intercept Consideration:**
   - Discuss the necessity of an intercept in the regression.
   - Explain why no intercept is needed based on data characteristics.

7. **Histogram of P-values and Distribution:**
   - Create a histogram of the p-values from the regression.
   - Discuss the distribution observed in the histogram.
   - Perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assess distribution.

8. **Expected Significant Variables and Alpha = 0.01:**
   - Explain the expectation of significant variables based on data generation.
   - Calculate the number of significant variables using alpha = 0.01.
   - Interpret the result as false discoveries due to random chance.

9. **FDR Control Using BH Procedure:**
   - Use the BH procedure to control FDR with q = 0.1.
   - Discuss the expected number of "true" discoveries.
   - Analyze the results of the FDR control procedure.
