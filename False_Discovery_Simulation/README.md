**Code Summary: Hypothesis Testing and False Discovery Rate**

The R codes focuses on hypothesis testing, false discovery rate (FDR), and regression analysis using simulated data.

1. **Setting Working Directory and Loading Packages:**
   - Set the working directory to a specified location.
   - Load the `ggplot2` package.

2. **FDR Function Definition:**
   - Define the `fdr` function that calculates the adjusted alpha using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for controlling the false discovery rate.
   - The function computes the alpha threshold based on the proportion of significant p-values.

3. **Generating Data Matrix:**
   - Create a 10,000 x 1001 matrix with random values from a normal distribution.
   - Treat the first column as the response variable "y" and the remaining 1000 columns as predictor variables "x".

4. **Regression Analysis and Intercept Consideration:**
   - Perform a linear regression of "y" on "x".
   - Examine the summary of the regression.
   - Calculate the residuals and create a histogram.
   - Perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the residuals to assess normality.
   - Calculate the mean of the residuals.
   - Discuss the necessity of an intercept in the regression and explain why no intercept is needed.

5. **Histogram of P-values and Distribution:**
   - Create a histogram of the p-values obtained from the regression.
   - Discuss the distribution observed in the histogram.
   - Perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on the p-values to assess uniformity.

6. **Expected Significant Variables and FDR Control:**
   - Explain the expectation of significant variables based on data generation.
   - Calculate the number of significant variables using alpha = 0.01.
   - Interpret the result as false discoveries due to random chance.

7. **FDR Control Using BH Procedure:**
   - Use the BH procedure to control the FDR with a q-value of 0.1.
   - Discuss the expected number of "true" discoveries.
   - Analyze the result of the FDR control procedure.
