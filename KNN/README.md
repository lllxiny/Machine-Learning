**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Performance Analysis**

The code evaluates the performance of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the Iris dataset. It explores how changing the number of neighbors (k) affects the accuracy of the KNN classifier. The goal is to determine the optimal value of k for accurate predictions and analyze the impact of different distance metrics.

1. **Package Import:**
   - Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.

2. **Data Loading and Preparation:**
   - Load the Iris dataset from 'iris.csv'.
   - Define the response variable "y" and predictor variables "x".

3. **Train-Test Split:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing subsets for model evaluation.

4. **KNN Model Creation and Evaluation:**
   - Initialize KNN models with different values of k (1, 3, 5, 7).
   - Train each KNN model on the training data.
   - Use the trained models to predict the variety in the test dataset.
   - Compare the predictions with the true labels to calculate accuracy.

5. **Accuracy Analysis for Different k Values:**
   - Create DataFrames to display the original labels, KNN predictions, and accuracy for each k value (1, 3, 5, 7).
   - Calculate accuracy scores and add them to the DataFrames.
   - Print accuracy results for each k value.

6. **Conclusion and Insight:**
   - Based on accuracy calculations, identify the optimal k value that provides the highest prediction accuracy (k=7).
   - Discuss the rationale for selecting Euclidean distance as the measurement for KNN.
   - Explain the use of out-of-sample (OOS) prediction accuracy to choose the best model.
   - Note that with a larger dataset, differences between k values would likely be more pronounced.
