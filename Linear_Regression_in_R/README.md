**Exploratory Data Analysis and Linear Regression on Autos Data**

This R Markdown code performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and builds a linear regression model on the "autos.csv" dataset. The dataset contains information about various automobile features and their prices.

1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration:**
   - The code loads the "autos.csv" dataset into the 'autos' dataframe and provides an overview of the dataset structure using `str()`.
   - It displays the column names and summary statistics of the dataset using `colnames()` and `summary()`.

2. **Exploring Character-Value Variables:**
   - The code explores relationships between categorical variables (e.g., 'make', 'fuel_type', 'body_style', etc.) and the target variable 'price' using boxplots and scatter plots.
   - It employs ggplot to visualize the counts of 'make' for each 'body_style' and 'fuel_type' using stacked bar plots.

3. **Exploring Number and Integer-Value Variables:**
   - The code generates scatter plots to analyze relationships between numeric variables and 'price', including 'curb_weight', 'engine_size', 'horsepower', 'city_mpg', and 'highway_mpg'.
   - It also uses ggplot to create scatter plots of 'length' against 'price' with color differentiation based on 'make' and linear regression lines.

4. **Creating a Linear Regression Model:**
   - A linear regression model is created using the formula `price~.` to predict the target 'price' based on all other variables in the dataset.
   - The model summary is displayed using `summary(autos_model)` to provide information about coefficients, p-values, and R-squared.

5. **Model Significance and Interpretation:**
   - The code extracts p-values of the model coefficients and counts the number of significant variables using a significance level of 0.05.
   - It interprets the significant variables and their relationship with the target 'price' for different categorical and numeric variables.

6. **False Discoveries and Control of False Discovery Rate (FDR):**
   - The code discusses the issue of false discoveries and the potential consequences of having multiple variables in the model.
   - It then uses the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (`fdr()`) to control the false discovery rate with a desired q-value of 0.1.
   - The number of true discoveries estimated by the procedure is calculated.

7. **Summary:**
   - The code concludes by summarizing the results of the BH procedure and the estimated number of true discoveries among the significant variables.
