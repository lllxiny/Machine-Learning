Performing various statistical analyses related to regression models, bootstrap resampling, and standard error estimation.

1. **Libraries**: Python NumPy, Pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn, seaborn, and plotnine.

2. **Regression Models**: Multiple regression techniques from `statsmodels` and `scikit-learn`. Logistic regression models (`sm.Logit`) and ordinary least squares regression models (`smf.ols`).

3. **Bootstrap Resampling**: Bootstrap resampling to estimate the standard errors of the treatment effects (TE) measured in a model named `confounder_control_2`. Fit regression models to the resampled data.

4. **Treatment Effect Estimation**: Calculates treatment effect estimates for each bootstrap resample and stores them in the `treatment_effects` matrix.

5. **Standard Error Estimation**: The standard errors of the treatment effect estimates are computed by calculating the standard deviation of the treatment effects across all bootstrap resamples. These standard errors are stored in the `treatment_effects_se` variable.
