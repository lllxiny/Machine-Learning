**Bootstrap Estimation of Treatment Effects**

The code performs bootstrap resampling to estimate the standard error of treatment effects measured in a logistic regression model.

1. **Package Import:**
   - Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, statistical modeling, and analysis.

2. **Bootstrap Estimation:**
   - Define the number of resampling iterations (n_resamples) for the bootstrap process.
   - Create an empty matrix to store treatment effect (TE) estimates for each resample.
   
3. **Bootstrap Procedure:**
   - Loop through the specified number of resamples.
   - Generate random resample indices with replacement from the original dataset.
   - Create resampled subsets of the data for predictors (x_resample) and response (y_resample).
   - Fit a logistic regression model (model1) to the resampled data.
   - Calculate predicted probabilities (y_hat) from the model1 and append them to the predictor matrix (x_new).
   - Fit a second logistic regression model (model2) to the augmented predictor matrix (x_new).
   - Store the treatment effect estimates from model2 in the treatment_effects matrix.

4. **Calculation of Standard Errors:**
   - Calculate the standard deviation of treatment effect estimates across the resamples, resulting in a vector of standard errors (treatment_effects_se).
